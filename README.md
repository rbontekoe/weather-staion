# Weather Station

In this project I use the [ESP32-WROOM-32](https://wiki.keyestudio.com/KS0413_keyestudio_ESP32_Core_Board) with the BME280 sensor (temperature, atmospheric pressure, and humidity) and the SSD1306 OLED display. The i2c bus is used for communiction with the sensor and display. I used the [Toit language](https://docs.toit.io/language) and [console](https://console.toit.io/devices).
